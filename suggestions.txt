work pls
we'll need two commands, something like !suggest_me where the bot says "I suggest you to <swim with dolpins>" and !suggest_user where the bot goes "I suggest Anx to <have gay sex with men>"
!random: rewrite output
migrate quotes to mysql
make !quote <user>
countermeasure for spamming commands in main channels (dont know who this is for)
!random <nickname> for random quotes of said nickname
